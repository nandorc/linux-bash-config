# Basher for Linux v3.1

This repository is intended to provide a simple way to customize linux terminal behaviour and give linux users tools to execute some administration tasks easy. It was tested on WSL.

## Installation

In order to install this tool, you must clone it at user directory (~) inside a folder named `.basher`. The following commands may be helpful to add the tool and include it at bash loading process.

~/.basher/setup.sh
```

That's it! If all goes well you just have to restart your system in order to use `basher` commands, `variables`, `aliases` and `styles` as well as to use auto-starting capabilities.
